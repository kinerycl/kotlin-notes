# Kahn’s Algorithm — Used for Topological Sorting 🗂️

- **Kahn’s Algorithm** — A method used for topological sorting of a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) 🔄
  - The algorithm processes nodes in a graph by repeatedly removing nodes with no incoming edges, and adding them to the topological order.
  - It uses a queue to keep track of nodes with no dependencies and processes them one by one.
