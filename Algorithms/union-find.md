# Union-Find (DSU - Disjoint Set Union) — Data structure for grouping elements based on their relationships 🔗

- **Union-Find** (also known as Disjoint Set Union or DSU) — A data structure that efficiently handles the grouping of elements into disjoint sets based on their relationships 🤝
  - **Union** operation: Merges two sets into one.
  - **Find** operation: Determines which set a particular element belongs to.
  - It is commonly used in problems involving connected components, such as in graph algorithms for detecting cycles or finding connected components.
  - Optimized with techniques like **path compression** and **union by rank** to make operations nearly constant time.
