# Tree Traversals ðŸŒ³

## Inorder Traversal
- **Inorder Traversal** â€” Visit Left, Root, Right. Commonly used for Binary Search Trees (BSTs) where it visits nodes in ascending order. ðŸ”¢

## Preorder Traversal
- **Preorder Traversal** â€” Visit Root, Left, Right. Used when the root needs to be processed before its children. ðŸš€

## Postorder Traversal
- **Postorder Traversal** â€” Visit Left, Right, Root. Often used for tasks like deleting a tree or calculating its values. ðŸ”™

## Morris Traversal
- **Morris Traversal** â€” A space-efficient tree traversal method that doesnâ€™t require recursion or a stack. It uses threaded binary trees. ðŸ“‰
